C++ Standard Template Library (STL)

STL is a set of C++ template classes which provides common
programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks,
arrays, etc.
It is a library that contains 3 well-structured components containers,
algorithms, and iterators.

1. Containers:
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/containers-cpp-stl/)
• These are used to manage collections of objects of a particular
type.
• Container library in STL provides containers that are used to
create data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.
• These containers are generic, they can store elements of any data
types.

2. Algorithms:
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/algorithms-library-c-stl/)
• Algorithms act on containers. These provide the means by which
one can perform initialization, sorting, searching & transforming
of containers’ contents.
• Algorithm library contains built in functions that performs
complex algorithms on the data structures. Example: reverse()
function, sort() function, binary_search(), etc.
• The algorithm library provides abstraction, i.e. you need not know
about how these algorithms work.

3. Iterators:
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterators-c-stl/)
• These are used to interact with the elements of collections of
objects. These collections may be containers or subsets of it.
• Iterators in STL are used to point to the containers.
• Iterators act as a bridge between containers & algorithms.
