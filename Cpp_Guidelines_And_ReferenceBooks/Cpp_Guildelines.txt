Hey guys,first let me give the answer for why cpp is essential.

1)C++ is an object-oriented (OO) programming language that can be very efficient. 
2)It was the first very widely used OO language. 
3)C++ was very important in the 90s and early 2000s.
4)C++ is still important in game programming and embedded device programming because in C++ you can:
5)Write programs that are very efficient in memory usage - no managed object overhead and no garbage collection pauses
6)Write programs that are very efficient in CPU usage - this language is very close to the hardware
7)C++ does suffer from trying to be upwards compatible to C which leads to some dangerous gaps (like the ability to corrupt memory). Conversely it provides loads of features. Some of these features can be really cool - like operator overloading (for example redefining what “+” means). This can lead to incomprehensible programs. The more recent versions of the C++ standard do improve the language, but you really need to make sure you used an understandable subset.
