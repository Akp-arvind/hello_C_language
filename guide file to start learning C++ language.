Official C++ documentation - Might be hard to follow and understand for beginners. Visit official C++ documentation. Write a lot of C++ programming code- The only way you can learn programming is by writing a lot of code. Read C++ code- Join Github's open-source projects and read other people's code.
C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop operating systems, browsers, games, and so on. C++ supports different ways of programming like procedural, object-oriented, functional, and so on. This makes C++ powerful as well as flexible.

There are two ways for learning  :
1. Paperbacks(With Books)
2. Online

If you prefer paperbacks, then you can refer the following books :

    The C++ Programming language by Bjarne Stroustrup. One of the best book because the guy who invented CPP wrote this book as well - For Professionals.
    C++ Primer by S. B. Lippman, J. Lajoie, B. E. Moo. - For beginners.
    Accelerated C++: Practical Programming by example by Andrew Koenig - For Intermediate

If you love to learn online, you can access the following sites for best results :

Learn from other developers. One of the best things about programming is that no matter
what level of skill you have in programming, there will always be source code readily available that is at that same level or one step above you.
A good way to learn from more complicated source code is to read through until you reach a point which you don't understand, then try to work it out in your head;
if you don't know a certain part of the code, read about it in your tutorial or reference material until you do.

Work through problems using the concepts you have learned. The absolute best way to retain what you learn isn't just writing out source code examples,
but actually accomplishing a set task with them. Both http://programming.com
and Project Euler have good problems that you could try solving to apply concepts in real-life situations. 
If you absolutely can't create an algorithm for a problem, then as a last resort check online for one done by someone else and learn from it.
What's the use of solving a problem if you don't learn from the result?
